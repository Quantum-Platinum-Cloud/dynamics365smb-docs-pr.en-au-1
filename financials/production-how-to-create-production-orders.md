# <a name="how-to-create-production-order-headers"></a>How to: Create Production Order Headers
You can create a production order manually, and the first step is to create a production order header.

Production orders are typically created automatically by a planning function to fulfil a known demand. For more information, see [Planning](production-planning.md).   

In the following procedure, a firm planned production order is created. You can also create production orders with a different status.  

## <a name="to-create-a-production-order-header"></a>To create a production order header  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  In the **No.** field, insert the next number in the series.  
4.  In the **Source Type** field, select the source of the production order.

    Here you can select to produce for a family of items. For more information, see [How to: Work With Production Families](production-how-work-family.md).
5.  In the **Source No.** field, select the item number, family, or sales header for which the production order is to be generated.  
6.  Fill in the **Quantity** and **Due Date** fields according to your specifications.  

When production requirements change, such as components or operations, you can quickly replan the production order. For more information, see [How to: Replan or Refresh Production Orders Directly](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md).
